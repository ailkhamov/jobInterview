## Stength and Weaknesses
My strongest asset is my work ethic and my willingness to step in when needed. I’m not afraid to do a task that I’ve had no experience of doing or do a project that nobody else wants because those are tasks and projects that teach me the most. During in my time at university while doing my final year project. I decided to do something completely out of my comfort zone. I’ve developed a mobile application using Android Studio with 0 knowledge and experience prior to doing this project. I’ve spend extra days and sacrificed my own personal time to complete and learn every on how to implement every core objective of my project.
